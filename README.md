# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to create a DataFrame using Pandas to summarize ride-sharing data by city type: rural, suburban, urban. I then plotted the data using Matplotlib in a line graph showing weekly fares for each city type over a course of four months to analyze any trends and make business recommendations to the CEO to address any disparities among different city types.


## Results:

As follows is a print of the DataFrame I created summarizing ride-sharing data which includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type:
